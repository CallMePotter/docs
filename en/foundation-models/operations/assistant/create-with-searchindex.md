  1. [Create](../../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) a service account and [assign](../../../iam/operations/sa/assign-role-for-sa.md) to it the `ai.assistants.editor` and `ai.languageModels.user` roles.
  1. [Get](../../../iam/operations/api-key/create.md) an API key for the service account and save it.  
  1. You can install the {{ ml-sdk-name }} library using the [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) package manager:

     ```bash
     pip install yandex-cloud-ml-sdk
     ```

  1. Download and unpack the [archive](https://storage.yandexcloud.net/doc-files/tours-example.zip) with examples of files that will be used as an additional source of information. The files contain advertising texts for tours to Bali and Kazakhstan generated by {{ gpt-pro }}.
  1. Create a file named `search-assistant.py` and add the following code to it:

     {% include [searchindex-assistant](../../../_includes/foundation-models/examples/searchindex-assistant.md) %}

  1. Run the created file:

     ```bash
     python3 search-assistant.py
     ```

{% endlist %}
