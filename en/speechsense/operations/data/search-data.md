# Searching data

You can use the API to search for voice call recordings and chat transcripts uploaded to {{ speechsense-name }}. The [Search](../../api-ref/grpc/Talk/search.md) method allows you to apply filters, sort data, and use pagination. The [Get](../../api-ref/grpc/Talk/get.md) method allows you to specify which data from the found conversations should be displayed.

{% include [authentication](../../../_includes/speechsense/data/authentication.md) %}

You can use the [gRPC API](search-data-grpc.md) or [REST API](search-data-rest.md) to search data.
